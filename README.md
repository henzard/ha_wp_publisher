## Adding the Custom Lovelace Card üé®

Since HA WP Publisher includes a custom Lovelace card for monitoring publish status, follow these steps to add it to your dashboard:

1. **Upload the Lovelace Card JavaScript File**:
   - Ensure `wp_publisher_status-card.js` is placed in the `www/wp_publisher_status-card/` directory of your Home Assistant configuration:
     ```
     /config/www/wp_publisher_status-card/wp_publisher_status-card.js
     ```

2. **Add Lovelace Resource**:
   - Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Resources**.
   - Click **Add Resource**.
   - **URL**: `/local/wp_publisher_status-card/wp_publisher_status-card.js`

   - Click **Create**.

3. **Add the Card to Your Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to your desired dashboard and enter **Edit** mode.
   - Click **Add Card** and select **Manual Card**.
   - Paste the following YAML configuration:
     ```yaml
     type: 'custom:wp-publisher-status-card'
     entity: sensor.wp_publisher_status
     ```
   - Adjust the `entity` field if your sensor has a different entity ID.
   - Click **Save** to add the card to your dashboard.

## Usage Notes üõ°Ô∏è

- **Authentication**:
  - For enhanced security, consider using [WordPress Application Passwords](https://wordpress.org/support/article/application-passwords/) instead of your main username/password.

- **Custom Endpoints**:
  - Modify `coordinator.py` to publish data to custom WordPress routes or plugin endpoints if needed.

- **Error Handling**:
  - HA WP Publisher gracefully handles connectivity issues by logging errors and retrying as configured.
